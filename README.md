Now you should have learned many things you need to know in order to start doing your own research and I hope you are keen to do so.

The goal of this assignment is to apply some of the things you have learned throughout the course.

<strong>Task 1: Finding Your Own Research Project </strong>

<em>Question 1: Assume that you have to do a one semester research project for next semester. Please identify a research project that interests you and that matches with your skills. List the title of the proposed project (1 marks), the research area of the project (1 mark) and the proposed ANU supervisor (1 mark).  </em>

The project you propose must be different from your team project in Assignment 3. You can either come up with your own project idea, or search for a project on one of our project pages, for

example: <u>https://cecs.anu.edu.au/current-students/student-research-projects</u>

Another possibility to find an interesting project is to visit the home pages of our research groups or of our individual researchers: <u>https://cecs.anu.edu.au/research</u>. There might be more projects listed on these pages.

There is also an ANU-wide page that has profiles and projects for most ANU researchers. This is particularly interesting as it allows you to search for keywords of topics that interest you:

<u>https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers</u>.

Just remember that all these project lists are by default never complete and never up to date.

If you are serious about finding a great research project, I recommend the following steps:

<ol>

 <li>Narrow down the list of possible supervisors (according to whatever criteria you want touse)</li>

 <li>Have a look at their publications and see if you can find something that you find particularlyinteresting. A good source for possible research projects is often the “Future Work” or “Discussion/Conclusion” section of publications.</li>

 <li>Talk to the potential supervisor and together develop a research project that is individuallytailored towards your interests, your situation and the interests of the supervisor.</li>

</ol>

As you can imagine, you probably won’t find any of these “personalised” projects advertised.

Note: Please only do step 3 if you are really looking for a research project and not just for the purpose of this assignment!

<strong>I strongly recommend that students who have to do a research project next semester (for example for COMP2560) use this opportunity to already pick their research project now! </strong>

<strong>This will give you a lot of additional time to prepare for your next project.</strong>

<strong>Task 2: Developing Your Project (12 marks) </strong>

Please answer the following questions for the research project you have selected in Task 1. Answering these questions before starting your research is very useful, both for yourself as well as for someone who evaluates your project proposal. Please try to keep your answers succinct and use your own words.

<em>Question 2: </em><em>What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon. Limit: half a page. (2 marks). </em>

<em>Question 3: What is the current state of the art in the area of your proposed project? Please give the full reference of 3 publications that represent the state of the art and briefly summarize each of them.</em> Limit: 1 page (3 marks).

<em>Question 4: What is new in your approach, how does it extend the state of the art? Why do you think it will work? </em>Limit: 1 page<em> (</em>2<em> marks) </em>

<em>Question 5: Why is this project interesting and important? Who can benefit if you are successful with it? Who cares? Limit: 1 page (2 marks) </em>

<em>Question 6: What should you do to properly prepare for the project (=before the next semester starts)? Limit: 1 page (1 mark)</em>

<em>Question 7: What are the fortnightly milestones you set yourself over the next semester in order to successfully complete the project? How will you know you succeeded? Limit: 1 page (2 marks</em>).

<em>Please note: the listed page limits are guidelines only to give you an idea how detailed your answers should be. One page is about 500-600 words. If you can answer the questions using less space, it’s ok. But please try not to use more space. </em>
